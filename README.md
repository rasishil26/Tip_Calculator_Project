# 💸 Tip Calculator – Python Project

Hi! I'm Rasi Shil 👋 and this is one of my beginner Python projects — a simple **Tip Calculator** that helps you split the bill and calculate how much each person should pay, including the tip.

This project gave me hands-on practice with variables, user input, basic math, and working with floats in Python.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

It takes:
- The total bill amount
- The percentage of tip you want to give
- The number of people splitting the bill

Then it calculates and prints how much **each person** should pay.

### 🧮 Sample Output:

Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? → 150.00
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? → 10
How many people to split the bill? → 3
Each person should pay: ₹55.00
